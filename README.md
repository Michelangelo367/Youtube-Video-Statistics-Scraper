# Youtube-Video-Info-Scraper

This script will automatically scrape the statistics<sup>1</sup> of every video from any channel/playlist the user gives it. There are two things to do first:
* get your Youtube API key ([text](https://www.slickremix.com/docs/get-api-key-for-youtube/)/[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th5_9woFJmk) guide)
* paste your Youtube API key into personal_api.py (follow comment instructions)
* make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed (a few f_strings used)

After that, the program should function correctly. Double click on "main.pyw" and a simple GUI box should pop up.




 <sup>1</sup> statistics includes, in order, the video title, date uploaded, views, likes, dislikes, comments, video id, duration (in seconds).
